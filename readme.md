## Usage
The main panel is the sequencer itself where you can turn on each of the instruments at any given placement.
Each node has 3 levels (velocity), indicated by the colors. Clicking on a node, cycles through the different levels.

Use the controls at the top bar to change the tempo, division, # of bars, time signature, EQ and reverb.

Click the play button at the bottom bar (or hit "spacebar") to start/stop playing.
